# Seren AI LangGraph - Advanced AI Agent Orchestration System

## Project Overview
Seren AI LangGraph is a sophisticated AI agent system built with LangGraph that implements a multi-node architecture for intelligent task planning, tool orchestration, and state management. The system features robust error handling, type safety, and intelligent routing capabilities.

This AI Agent System automates the management of tasks, shifts, and notes for a business frontend app. Actions are generated by the LLM but executed on the client side via the interrupt node `execute_ai_request_on_client`.

To achieve conversational response times, the system uses Groq with Llama models, optimizing for speed while implementing additional checks and system prompts to handle potential LLM output issues.

## Core AI Components

### 1. Intelligent Planning Node (`src/nodes/node_planner.py`)
- **Purpose**: Orchestrates decision-making and workflow routing
- **Key Features**:  
  - Manages a plan of completed and pending actions
  - Routes to appropriate execution nodes
  - Implements iteration limiting to prevent infinite loops

### 2. Tool Caller Node (`src/nodes/node_tool_caller.py`)
- **Purpose**: Executes tool calls based on the plan
- **Key Features**:
  - Analyzes context to determine appropriate tool parameters
  - Generates structured tool calls
  - Handles exceptions during tool execution
  - Provides feedback for error recovery

### 3. Response Generator Node (`src/nodes/node_response_generator.py`)
- **Purpose**: Creates user-facing responses
- **Key Features**:
  - Generates helpful, concise responses based on the plan
  - Incorporates information from tool executions
  - Maintains conversational context
  - Adapts to user's language and UI context

### 4. State Management System (`src/agent_state.py`)
- **Purpose**: Maintains state across iterations
- **Key Features**:
  - Comprehensive state tracking with TypedDict
  - UI context preservation
  - Flexible behavior modes (chat/single_call)
  - Message history management

## Tool Capabilities

### Task Management Tools
- Create, update, and delete tasks
- Find tasks based on various criteria (name, dates, status, priority)
- Add comments to tasks
- Show task information to users

### Note Management Tools
- Create, update, and delete notes
- Find notes based on criteria
- Share notes with others
- Display notes to users

### Shift Management Tools
- Get shift assignments and logs
- Toggle clock in/out status
- Retrieve current shift information

## Technical Implementation

### Graph Architecture
- **Core Components**:
  - Intelligent routing based on behavior modes
  - Context-aware decision making
  - Tool execution validation

### Safety & Validation
- **Type Safety**:
  - Pydantic models for structured outputs
  - Validated tool inputs/outputs
  - State schema enforcement
- **Error Handling**:
  - Comprehensive exception management
  - Iteration limiting
  - Feedback loops for recovery

## Technical Stack
